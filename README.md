# TapTalk - Interactive Reading App for Kids

TapTalk is a mobile application designed to help children learn to read by using the phone's camera to recognize words and sentences. When a child points the camera at a word, the app reads it aloud using phonics. Children can also drag their finger across a sentence to have it read word by word.

## Features

- **Word Recognition**: Point the camera at a word to have it recognized and read aloud
- **Phonics-Based Reading**: Words are pronounced using phonics to help with learning proper pronunciation
- **Sentence Reading**: Drag across a sentence to have it read word by word
- **Kid-Friendly Interface**: Colorful, intuitive design suitable for children

## Technical Implementation

The app will be built using:
- React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development
- Camera API for image capture
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for text detection
- Text-to-Speech with phonics capabilities
- Touch gesture recognition for the dragging feature

## Required Libraries/Dependencies

- React Native / Flutter
- React Native Camera / Flutter Camera
- Google ML Kit for text recognition
- React Native TTS / Flutter TTS for text-to-speech
- Gesture recognition library

## Development Roadmap

1. Set up the development environment
2. Implement camera functionality
3. Add text recognition
4. Implement text-to-speech with phonics
5. Add touch/drag functionality
6. Design and implement kid-friendly UI
7. Testing with children
8. Refinement based on feedback

## Getting Started

Instructions for setting up the development environment will be provided once the technology stack is finalized.
