# TapTalk Technical Requirements

This document outlines the technical requirements and considerations for implementing the TapTalk app.

## Core Functionality Requirements

### 1. Camera and Image Processing

- **Camera Access**: The app must be able to access the device's camera and maintain a continuous preview.
- **Image Capture**: Ability to capture frames at regular intervals for text recognition.
- **Image Processing**: Pre-processing of captured images to optimize for text recognition (contrast enhancement, noise reduction).
- **Permissions**: Proper handling of camera permissions on both Android and iOS.

### 2. Text Recognition (OCR)

- **Real-time Recognition**: The app should recognize text in near real-time (within 1-2 seconds).
- **Word Detection**: Ability to detect individual words and their boundaries.
- **Sentence Detection**: Ability to identify complete sentences and the words within them.
- **Text Tracking**: Track recognized text across frames to maintain stability.
- **Language Support**: Initially English, with potential for expansion to other languages.

### 3. Text-to-Speech with Phonics

- **Phonics Mapping**: Convert recognized words to their phonetic pronunciation.
- **Speech Synthesis**: High-quality, child-friendly voice for reading words aloud.
- **Speed Control**: Adjustable reading speed for different learning levels.
- **Word Highlighting**: Visual indication of the word being read.
- **Sentence Reading**: Sequential reading of words in a sentence with appropriate pacing.

### 4. Touch and Gesture Recognition

- **Tap Detection**: Recognize when a user taps on a specific word.
- **Drag Detection**: Track finger movement across words in a sentence.
- **Multi-touch Support**: Handle multiple finger inputs for potential future features.

### 5. User Interface

- **Kid-friendly Design**: Large buttons, bright colors, and intuitive layout.
- **Responsive Layout**: Support for different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and other accessibility features.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Visual and audio feedback for user actions.

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

- **Frame Rate**: Maintain at least 15 FPS during camera preview.
- **Recognition Latency**: Text recognition should complete within 500ms.
- **Memory Usage**: Keep memory usage below 200MB.
- **Battery Impact**: Minimize battery consumption during continuous use.

### Platform-specific Requirements

#### Android

- **Minimum API Level**: Android 7.0 (API level 24) or higher.
- **Camera2 API**: Utilize Camera2 API for better camera control.
- **Text Recognition**: Use ML Kit or Tesseract OCR for text recognition.
- **TTS Engine**: Use Android's built-in TTS engine with phonics extensions.

#### iOS

- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 13.0 or higher.
- **AVFoundation**: Use AVFoundation for camera access.
- **Vision Framework**: Use Vision framework for text recognition.
- **AVSpeechSynthesizer**: Use AVSpeechSynthesizer for text-to-speech.

## Development Approach

### Cross-platform Options

1. **React Native**
   - Pros: Faster development, code sharing between platforms
   - Cons: Potential performance issues with camera and ML processing
   - Required Libraries:
     - react-native-camera
     - react-native-mlkit-text-recognition
     - react-native-tts
     - react-native-gesture-handler

2. **Flutter**
   - Pros: Better performance, consistent UI across platforms
   - Cons: Steeper learning curve
   - Required Libraries:
     - camera
     - google_ml_kit
     - flutter_tts
     - gesture_detector

3. **Native Development**
   - Pros: Best performance and platform integration
   - Cons: Separate codebases for Android and iOS
   - Android Libraries:
     - CameraX
     - ML Kit
     - Android TTS
   - iOS Libraries:
     - AVFoundation
     - Vision
     - AVSpeechSynthesizer

### Recommended Approach

For the best balance of development speed and performance, we recommend using **Flutter** with the following packages:

- `camera`: For camera access and control
- `google_ml_kit`: For text recognition
- `flutter_tts`: For text-to-speech functionality
- Native gesture detection through Flutter's `GestureDetector`

This approach provides:
- Good performance for real-time text recognition
- Consistent UI across platforms
- Single codebase for easier maintenance
- Strong community support and documentation

## Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: For core logic components (text recognition, phonics mapping)
- **Integration Tests**: For camera and TTS integration
- **UI Tests**: For gesture recognition and user interface
- **User Testing**: With the target audience (children learning to read)
- **Performance Testing**: Under various lighting conditions and text complexities

## Deployment Considerations

- **App Store Guidelines**: Ensure compliance with Apple App Store guidelines
- **Google Play Guidelines**: Ensure compliance with Google Play Store guidelines
- **Privacy Policy**: Create a privacy policy addressing camera usage and data collection
- **Age Rating**: Appropriate age rating for educational children's app

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Languages**: Support for additional languages
- **Custom Phonics Rules**: Allow teachers/parents to customize phonics rules
- **Progress Tracking**: Track child's reading progress
- **Gamification**: Add game elements to make learning more engaging
- **Offline Mode**: Function without internet connection
- **Cloud Sync**: Sync progress across devices
